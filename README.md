Please note, when I say "empty string", I'm including 0 length strings or strings with nothing but whitespace characters.

wh_txt_schema (Passing the attribute with no value or an empty string is the same as not including the attribute.)
wh_txt_use_header (Pass single character 'y' or 'n'. Case-insensitive. Not including this attribute is the same as passing it with 'n'.)
wh_txt_delim (Passing the attribute with a 0 length string is the same as not including the attribute.)
wh_txt_quote (Passing the attribute with an empty string is the same as not including the attribute.)
wh_txt_escape (Passing the attribute with an empty string is the same as not including the attribute.)
wh_txt_skip_lines (Passing the attribute with an empty string is the same as not including the attribute.)
